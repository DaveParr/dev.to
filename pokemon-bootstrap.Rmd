## How strong is any given Pokemon?

Pokemon games have a very familiar cycle. You start with one of 3 Pokemon. You adventure out with your new buddy, facing tougher and tougher Pokemon, in greater variety. Many of your Pokemon evolve over time, and eventually you find the end-game legendaries in a climactic battle of titans! 

```{r}
pokemon %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = id,
    y = base_experience
  )) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap( ~ generation_id, scales = "free_x", ncol = 1)
```
